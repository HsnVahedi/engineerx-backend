## Introduction to EngineerX project

EngineerX is an open source web application designed for engineers and specialists letting them share their ideas, create tutorials, represent themselves, employ other specialists and ...

Currently, The project is at it's first steps and includes a simple but awesome [Content Management System (CMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system) that lets content providers to create and manage blog posts.

Key features of the project:

- It's [cloud native](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_native_computing) and can easily get deployed on popular cloud providers like (AWS, Azure and ...)
- It benefits from microservices architectural best practices. It uses technologies like [docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) to provide a horizontally scalable infrastructure with high availability.
- It includes a wide range of popular development frameworks and libraries like: [django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), [reactjs](https://reactjs.org/), [nextjs](https://nextjs.org/), [wagtail](https://wagtail.io/) and ...
- It benefits from [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) best practices and uses [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#module-unittest), [jest](https://jestjs.io/), [react-testing-library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) and [cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for different kinds of tests.
- It uses [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) declarative pipeline syntax to implement [CI/CD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD) pipelines. (Pipeline as code)
- Developers are able to write different kinds of tests and run them in a parallelized and non-blocking manner.
- It uses [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) to provision the required cloud infrastructure so it's really easy to deploy the whole project and destroy it whenever it's not needed any more. (Infrastructure as code)
- It has built on top of wagtail. Wagtail enables django developers to have a professional headless CMS which can be customized for many types of businesses.

## What's included
This repository contains the project's backend microservices. The most important microservice is a django project located [here](https://github.com/HsnVahedi/engineerx-backend/tree/main/engineerx), which is created by wagtail.

Wagtail has many built-in features including Elastic Search integration. To see all of wagtail's built-in features, check [this](https://wagtail.io/features/#) out.

Here is our blog's PostPage which inherits wagtail's Page:

    class PostPage(Page):
        image = models.ForeignKey(
            'wagtailimages.Image',
            null=True,
            blank=True,
            on_delete=models.SET_NULL,
            related_name='+'
        )
        sections = StreamField(SectionsBlock())
        tags = ClusterTaggableManager(through=TaggedPost, blank=True)

        api_fields = [
            APIField('image', serializer=ImageRenditionField('min-1500x200')),
            APIField('image_16x9', serializer=ImageRenditionField('fill-1600x900-c70', source='image')),
            APIField('sections'),
            APIField('tags'),
            APIField('owner_info'),
        ]

        content_panels = Page.content_panels + [
            ImageChooserPanel('image'),
            StreamFieldPanel('sections'),
            FieldPanel('tags')
        ]

The page model has a few fields:

- `sections`: Contains page's content. Check Wagtail's StreamField [Documentation](https://docs.wagtail.io/en/stable/topics/streamfield.html) to know more about it's amazing features.
